      <ul>
        <li>Create a project folder somewhere on your systems and clone the seed from here:
          <p>TODO</p>
        </li>
        <li>But since you are already looking at this page, you have probably already done this ;-)</li>

        Architecture
      </uib-accordion-heading>

      <p>This Version of the Seed provides a Node/Express backend and an Angular Frontend, all encapsulated in a single
        Express project (for simplicity)</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Place backend code as usually for an Express application</li>
        <li>Client Code (Angular) should be placed in the <em>public/app Folder</em></li>
        <li>Out of the box the seed supports Handlebars for server-side rendering (other rendering-technologies, like
          Jade or EJS can easily be included)
        </li>
      </ul>

        Backend Architecture
      </uib-accordion-heading>
      <p>This should come as no surprise to you.</p>
      <p>It's a basic Express Generated project, with code added to support the features of this seed</p>

        Frontend Architecture
      </uib-accordion-heading>
      <p>The seed is built from <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular-seed">AngularJSs</a> seed and the
        application skeleton of the seed is therefore heavily inspired by this seed.</p>
      <p>This seed is "twisted" to make it easier to use in a school, see this <a
              href="https://scotch.io/tutorials/angularjs-best-practices-directory-structure">link</a> for alternative
        seed-structures.</p>
      <p>All Angular-code is added in the app-folder in the public folder</p>

        Security Features in the Seed
      </uib-accordion-heading>
      <h3>Test Users: (logon with these credentials to test authentication)</h3>
      <p>The Backend supports whatever roles you come up with. Out of the box the <b>front-end</b> only handles the
        roles "user" and "admin" (spelled like this).
        Adding more is however simple</p>
      <h3>Using the Security Features in this seed - <em>Server:</em></h3>
      <p>Decorate your REST classes and or methods with theese annotations: <em>@PermitAll</em> <em>@DenyAll</em> <em>@RolesAllowed</em>
      <p>See the section Securing RESTful Web Services Using Annotations here: <a
              href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E24329_01/web.1211/e24983/secure.htm#RESTF256">Securing RESTful Web
        Services</a>
      <P>See The server package <b>rest</b> provides examples of services using both the <em>User</em> and
        <em>Admin</em> Roles</p>
      <p>Username, password, and roles are hardcoded in UserFacade.java and the User Class (your task is to place this
        info in a database)</p>

      <h3>Using the Security Features in this seed - <em>Client</em>:</h3>
      <p>Logon/logout (local) is ready to use, once your database is started</p>
      <h4>Facebook Login</h4>
      <p>You need to setup two (one for local development, and one for production (OPENSHIFT) apps on Facebook.
        Add the relevant values for clientID, clientSecret and callBackUrl into <em>config/auth</em>
      </p>
      <p>A token with credentials is automatically attached to all outgoing requests (when you are logged on) </p>
      <p>In this version users can see all menu items (even if they do not have the necessary rights). This is for you
        to

        observe when and where security takes place (bring up F12 in chrome and monitor the network traffic)
      <p>
      <p>You can hide elements (menu-items) so they are only visible when logged on with the required security role. Add
        <code>ng-show="isUser"</code> to
        the "view2" anchor tag in index.html and <code>ng-show="isAdmin"</code> on the "view2" tag. To see this in
        action.</p>
      <p>Everything you do, that relates to security on the client, can be tampered with, so the trick above should be
        seen as
        something to make the system more user friendly. <span style="text-decoration: underline">The real security is how REST (our data) is protected on the server. </span>
      </p>
      <h4>Not sending the JWT for specific requests</h4>
      <p>In some cases (for example when doing Cross Origin Calls) we don not want to include the jwt-token with the
        request</p>
      <p>Use the skipAutherization property as sketched below, to prevent the Token from being include with a
        request</p>
      <pre>
        $http({
          url: '/hola',
          <b>skipAuthorization: true</b>
          method: 'GET'
        });</pre>
      <p>Security in this seed was inspired by these articles</p>
      <ul style="list-style: none">
        <li><a href="https://auth0.com/blog/2014/01/07/angularjs-authentication-with-cookies-vs-token/">Cookies vs
          Tokens. Getting auth right with Angular.JS</a></li>

    <uib-accordion-group heading="Adding new files">

      The single most import thing to realize about this, and all other, seeds is how "wirred up".
      <p>As an example, let's see what it will take to include a new view:</p>
      <p>Create a new folder for the view and create (as a minimum) an html-template and a JavaScript file with (as a
        minimum) the route-handling for the view. In this file provide a name as sketched below:</p>
      <p><code> angular.module('myApp.<b>nameForTheView</b>', ['ngRoute'])</code></p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold">Important:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Copy the text: 'myApp.nameForTheView' from the *.js-file into the <em>app.js-file</em> (just look into the
          file to see how)
        </li>
        <li>Important: include the file in index.html (just look into the file to see how all other js-files are
          included)</p></li>
      </ol>
      <p>Now you can use your new view from anywhere in your application using the url you provided for the
        route-handling</p>
    </uib-accordion-group>
    <uib-accordion-group heading="Removing Unnecessary Page/Code">
      <p>Whenever you use a wizard or a seed as a starting point for your applications it is important to remove code
        not relevant for what you are doing.</p>
      <p>One thing you always will have to remove is the "Using the Seed"-view.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Delete the <em>view4-folder</em> and all its content.</li>
        <li>Remove the "injection" 'myApp.view4' in <em>app.js </em></li>
        <li>Remove the script-include in the file <em>index.html</em></li>
        <li>Remove the "menu-entry" in <em>index.html</em></li>
      </ol>

        Hosting on OPENSHIFT
      </uib-accordion-heading>
      <p>The seed is prepared for OPENSHIFT-hosting and detects when running on OPENSHIFT, and automatically switch to
        use the following OPENSHIFT environment variables:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>process.env.OPENSHIFT_NODEJS_PORT</li>
        <li>process.env.OPENSHIFT_NODEJS_IP</li>
        <li>process.env.OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_PASSWORD</li>
        <li>process.env.OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_HOST</li>
        <li>process.env.OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_PORT</li>
        <li>process.env.OPENSHIFT_APP_NAME</li>
      </ul>
